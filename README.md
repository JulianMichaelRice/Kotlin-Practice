# Kotlin Practice
 (Kotlin, Android Studio) Some projects where I practice Kotlin for Android Development

### Application1
This is a simple random number generator based off of the Android Tutorial (Ch 1)

### AboutMe
This is a simple biography scrollable page based off of the Android Tutorial (Ch 2)

### CameraFilter
This is a camera project using the deprecated (at the moment) Camera library to provide filters.
Will likely be a good base to develop non-deprecated, camera filter functionality. Was good practice.
